## Responsive Navbar

### About:

The navigation bar is fully responsive. On larger screens, the navigation links are displayed inline, while on smaller screens, a toggle button appears to show or hide the menu. It includes links to various sections, a logo, and social icons. The project demonstrates the use of React hooks, particularly the `useRef` hook for managing the dropdown menu state.
